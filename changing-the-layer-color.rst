Changing the Layer Color
########################

The ability to modify layer colors at runtime is useful for when:

* An overlay is difficult to notice in the image (eg. A green overlay drawn over a green part of an image)
* Two layers are indistinguishable from each other (eg. Two layers using the same plugin type, listening on different topics)

To change the color of a layer, simply **double-click** the color tile in the rightmost column of
the layer, as highlighted below:

.. image:: images/color_column.png
  :align: center

A color dialog will pop up, where you can select a color, or create your custom color.
By default, the layer color is black.

  :align: center

Once you press the Select button to close the dialog, you should see the layer update with the color
you selected. In the image below, a light green color was selected:

.. image:: images/green_layer.png
  :align: center

.. tip::

  The transparency of the layer can also be modified using a custom color.
